Square Market Item Embedding
============================

This repository contains examples for embedding items from
[Square Market][market] into your own website.

You can read more about embedding and sharing items in our
[Help Center][help-center].

Basic Embedding
---------------

You can find embed code on item pages throughout Square Market. Any item that is
for sale and has an image can be embedded. Start by clicking the embed icon
alongside our icons for sharing on Twitter, Facebook, etc:

<img src="embed-button.png">

The code shown can be copied and pasted into the HTML for your page:

<img src="embed-modal.png">

Check the preview to see what the finished item will look like in your site:

<img src="embed-preview.png">


Advanced Embedding
------------------

Browse the code in this repository for examples of different embedding
techniques, or view the source for our examples live in our
[github pages](https://square.github.io/square-market-embeds).

Our [favorite sample][masonry-sample] so far uses the Masonry library to create
a crisp, clean layout for a large number of embedded items.
